## Microsoft Build

Forking my first Microsoft software repository to develop on proved what I had 
thought from the very beginning.  Just a simple plug-and-play of sorts is way
more involved than it need or should be.  They have obfuscated every step and
couldn't be any more different.

That being said, I look forward to learning and understanding the **why** and
the __how__ Microsoft does what they do.
